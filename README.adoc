= Apache ActiveMQ Failover example

This example shows how to set up 2 Apache ActiveMQ message brokers in a failover maner. 
At this moment, there is only one master and one slave. 
One of them will start and become the master, the other one will wait till mthe master goes down so it can be promoted to master.

Both servers are configured to use a JDBC persistence adapter and we will be using a MariaDB SQL database.

To make it easier to test and run locally, this is built on Docker.
